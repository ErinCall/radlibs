            <h4>The Language</h4>
            <p>If you're familiar with the idea of Madlibs, you're already familiar with the basics of Radlibs. A Radlib includes any amount of text and any number of references to <em>Libraries</em>. A Library contains one or more Radlibs. When a Radlib is <em>expanded</em>, a random sub-Radlib is chosen from each referenced Library.</p>
            <p>Thus, if you have a Library called "Verb", containing a few verbs:</p>
            <pre class="listing">
sing
run
fart
wash</pre>
            <p>and a Library called "Adverb", containing a few of those:</p>
            <pre class="listing">
wetly
exuberantly
joyfully
slowly</pre>
            <p>Then you can write a short Radlib that uses them:</p>
            <pre class="listing">I love to &lt;Verb&gt; &lt;Adjective&gt;!</pre>
            <p>The Radlibs engine will select a random Verb and a random Adjective from the supplied lists and generate a sentence with it:</p>
            <pre class="listing">I love to run exuberantly!</pre>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row-fluid marketing">
        <div class="span12">
            <h4>Recursion</h4>
            <p>Libraries' contents are themselves Radlibs. Thus, they can reference other libraries! This is where things really start to get rad. Suppose you have a Library called "Loot":</p>
            <pre class="listing">
+5 Sword
Gold piece
Heavy Truncheon
bolt</pre>
            <p>Then you could define a library called "Treasure":</p>
            <pre class="listing">
you find 1 &lt;Loot&gt;.
you find 5 &lt;Loot&gt;s.
bonanza! You find over 9000 &lt;Loot&gt;s!</pre>
            <p>Now you can go treasure-hunting:</p>
            <pre class="listing">
Upon opening the chest, &lt;Treasure&gt;</pre>
            <p>You'll find something or other&hellip;</p>
            <pre class="listing">
Upon opening the chest, you find 5 bolts.</pre>
        </div>
